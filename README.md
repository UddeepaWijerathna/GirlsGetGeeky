# :ribbon: GirlsGetGeeky :ribbon:
GirlsGetGeeky is a project that addresses the following issues:
- Poor internet  hindering the ability for beginners to access good courses with solutions to common problems.
- A large number of ladies who take a technology course in the University end up taking a job parallel to tech.
- For beginners, there is no a structured course /syllabus to help them move from beginner to advanced level

## :mag: About
GirlsGetGeeky big picture is to build a fun offline course available on usb sticks.  The offline course should
have all the important resources that one needs to effectively learn the programming language in question.
We are currently building an offline study course for Ruby. After the Ruby course is finished we will move to other languages.  
We will build these courses and instructions in markdown files.
