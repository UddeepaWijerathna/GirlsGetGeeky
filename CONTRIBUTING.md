## Contributing
:sparkles: Thank you for considering to contribute on this project :sparkles:  
Have you checked out our [code of conduct?](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) All contributors should adhere to the guidelines outlined here.
We welcome developers who have experience in Ruby on Rails and Javascript as this are the main languages used in the development of this project.
It does not matter your experience there is issues for everyone based on your skills and experience.  
As of now, the offline course in development is Ruby on Rails.

### Getting Started
To get started look for an issue to work on. We use the fork-and-pull Git workflow

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.
2. Clone the project to your own machine.
3. Commit changes to your own branch.
4. Push your work back up to your fork.
5. Submit a Pull request and assign a reviewer.

Remember to rebase regularly when working on an issue and pulling upstream before you get started on an issue.

### Branching
We have a convention of naming branches. If the issue has a feature label

`feature/issue_description-#issue_number`

If the issue has a bugfix label

`bugfix/issue_description-#issue_number`

### Reporting an Issue
If you come across a bug add it on the issues and talk to any of the project maintainers to make sure you do not duplicate an issue.

### Communication
We have a [slack channel](https://getgeeky.slack.com) where all communications are held but if its a conversation about an issue leave a comment on the issue's trail.
