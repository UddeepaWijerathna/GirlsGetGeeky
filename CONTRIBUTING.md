Have you checked out our [code of conduct?](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) All contributors should adhere to the guidelines outlined here.
We are building an offline course written using markdowns. These markdowns will give someone all that is required 
We welcome developers who have experience in Ruby on Rails as this are the main languages used in the development of this offline course now.  
We also welcome suggestions on how to better our content and how to do something in a better way.  

You do not need to have experience in Ruby or Rails to contribute on this. We have a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xGCUERBpS2WQPe8DUZQCEolvKUmCGRQy2D9E5A4waO0/edit?usp=sharing) for this
It does not matter your experience there is issues for everyone based on your skills and experience.  
As of now, the offline course in development is Ruby on Rails.

## Getting Started
To get started look for an issue to work on. We use the fork-and-pull Git workflow

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.
2. Clone the project to your own machine.
3. Commit changes to your own branch.
4. Push your work back up to your fork.
5. Submit a Pull request and assign a reviewer.

Remember to rebase regularly when working on an issue and pulling upstream before you get started on an issue.

## Branching
We have a convention of naming branches. If the issue has a feature label

`feature/issue_description-#issue_number`

If the issue has a bugfix label

`bugfix/issue_description-#issue_number`
