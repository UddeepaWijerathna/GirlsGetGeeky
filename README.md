GirlsGetGeeky is a project that addresses the following issues:
- Poor internet  hindering the ability for beginners to access good courses with solutions to common problems.
- A large number of ladies who take a technology course in the University end up taking a job parallel to tech.
- For beginners, there is no a structured course /syllabus to help them move from beginner to advanced level
