# :ribbon: GirlsGetGeeky :ribbon:
GirlsGetGeeky is a project that addresses the following issues:
- Poor internet  hindering the ability for beginners to access good courses with solutions to common problems.
- Minute number of ladies in tech and STEM in general, in Kenya and other African countries. A large number of those who take a technology course in the University end up taking a job parallel to tech. 
- For beginners, there is no a structured course /syllabus to help them move from beginner to advanced level

## Our Goal
- Build a fun offline course  available on usb sticks, that has all the important resources that one needs to effectively learn the programming language in question. We will begin with Ruby on Rails then later add more languages.

## Contributing

### Getting Started
To get started look for an issue to work on. We use the fork-and-pull Git workflow

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.
2. Clone the project to your own machine.
3. Commit changes to your own branch.
4. Push your work back up to your fork.
5. Submit a Pull request and assign a reviewer.

Remember to rebase regularly when working on an issue and pulling upstream before you get started on an issue.

### Branching
We have a convention of naming branches. If the issue has a feature label

`feature/issue_description-#issue_number`

If the issue has a bugfix label

`bugfix/issue_description-#issue_number`

### Reporting an Issue
If you come across a bug add it on the issues and talk to any of the project maintainers to make sure you do not duplicate an issue.

### Communication
We have a [slack channel](https://getgeeky.slack.com) where all communications are held but if its a conversation about an issue leave a comment on the issue's trail.
