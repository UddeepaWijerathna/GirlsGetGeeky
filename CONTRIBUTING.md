# Contributing
:sparkles: Thank you for considering to contribute on this project :sparkles:  
Have you checked out our [code of conduct?](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) All contributors should adhere to the guidelines outlined here.  
We are building an offline course written using markdowns. These markdowns will give someone all that is required to continue learning the programming language at hand, offline. As of now, the offline course in development is for Ruby on Rails.  
We have three types of contributors. 
1. Contributors sharing their experience with Ruby on Rails. Tell us about your challenges and how you overcame them,
tutorials that worked for you, dos and don'ts in Rails or Ruby. For these, look for an issue with a label `storytelling` and add a comment as
a contribution to the issue.
2. Contributors giving thoughts on how we can improve this course, code examples for our course, how what we should include in our content or any other thing that can not be added as an issue. We want this project to be as open as possible. And so any thoughts are welcome and will be put to consideration. We have a google doc dedicated to this find it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xGCUERBpS2WQPe8DUZQCEolvKUmCGRQy2D9E5A4waO0/edit?usp=sharing)
3. Contributors contributing to the development of the course. For now, these contributors should have skills in:  
 `Ruby on Rails`  
 `Markdown` [Here is a cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to perfect your markdown skills or get started.

 However not all issues require experience in Ruby on Rails. You can check the issues and see if there is anything you can contribute on.

## Getting Started
To get started look for an issue to work on. We use the fork-and-pull Git workflow

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.
2. Clone the project to your own machine.
3. Commit changes to your own branch.
4. Push your work back up to your fork.
5. Submit a Pull request and assign a reviewer.

Remember to rebase regularly when working on an issue and pulling upstream before you get started on an issue.

## Branching
We have a convention of naming branches. If the issue has a feature label

`feature/issue_description-#issue_number`

If the issue has a bugfix label

`bugfix/issue_description-#issue_number`

## What we are working on
The project is its early stage and we are getting a lot things figured out.  
You are welcome to give your thoughts and contributions on any of the three sections below
1. Browse through our issues and find an something to work on, please leave a comment saying hi and you are working on the issue.  
You can also ask for clarification there or anything else you need to get started on the issue.
2. Ideas on how to better our content and markdowns. *To be added on [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xGCUERBpS2WQPe8DUZQCEolvKUmCGRQy2D9E5A4waO0/edit?usp=sharing)*
3. Content we should add on the course. *To be added on [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xGCUERBpS2WQPe8DUZQCEolvKUmCGRQy2D9E5A4waO0/edit?usp=sharing)*


## Reporting an Issue
If you come across a bug add it on the issues and talk to any of the project maintainers to make sure you do not duplicate an issue.

## Communication
We have a [slack channel](https://getgeeky.slack.com) where all communications are held but if its a conversation about an issue leave a comment on the issue's trail.
